# Write the value into a YAML file under the `/data` folder


# Hugo will pick up the YAML value and render it into the docs using a shortcode


# We should probably shuffle the build scripts around some.
# 1. init env vars in the `before_install.sh` file, or define a new one that inits all env vars that build scripts will use
# 2. run scripts that pull data
# 3. run hugo, etc. 

# Wishlist:
# * an override setting that allows us to run this locally and build a file that can be used to override the automated output. We can put an if statement into
#   the template to pull the override file rather than the generated one if it exists. This would be most useful in other data pull scripts, maybe not here.
